							<p>Regardless of changing trends, simplicity and minimalism will always be relevant. Minimize distracting factors on the website, and you will see the number of satisfied users increase. Vice versa, any excessive complications can scare some users away.
                                 Meeting the needs of the user is the most important objective of any web project.</p> 
                                 <br>
                                 <p>Therefore, when you implement some features, you should never forget about the usability priority. User interactions with the web interface should be intuitively easy.</p>
